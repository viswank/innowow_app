					<h3>Consulting</h3>
						<b>
						<p>
					We provide consultancy for solving the client’s software problems, perform customer requirements analysis,
					and produce comprehensive functional specifications for the software to be developed. This ensures that the
					intended software will indeed solve the customer’s problems. The Functional Specifications documents contains
					the system’s functionality points, the performance specifications, the system limitations, the proposed system
					architecture, the GUI layouts, and report layouts, the business logic, the process flows, the use cases, and the GUI
					and report field descriptions. </b>
						</p></td>

					<h3>Development</h3>
						<b>
						<p>

					As part of the requirements analysis, we can build a Rapid Prototype of the system being conceived, 
					so that the customer can visually see the finished system that he is going to get. A prototype is a 
					rough and dirty system made for demonstration purposes. It demonstrates most of the functionality of
					 the intended application in working form, although some of the behind-the-scenes functionality may 
					 be missing, such as permanent saving of the data in a database. The final system is well-designed and 
					 well-engineered, and is started from scratch. 

						</p></td>


					<h3>Customer Support and Training</h3>
						
						<p>
					We can provide on-site, phone, or email support, as per client agreement, in order to ensure that you 
					do not face any problems while getting started with your new systems. Support can be first-level 
					(directly to all your end-users) or second-level (to your local experts). We can provide on-site or 
					off-site customer training of the appropriate duration, depth and difficulty–level, as per client 
					agreement, to ensure that you can get started with your new systems as quickly and conveniently as 
					possible.
